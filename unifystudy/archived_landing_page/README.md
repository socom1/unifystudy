# Archived Landing Page

This folder contains the original landing page files that were part of the UnifyStudy application.

## Files Included
- `LandingPage.tsx` - Main landing page component
- `LandingPage.scss` - Styles for the landing page
- `LandingPage.css` - Compiled CSS
- `LandingPage.css.map` - Source map for CSS

## Why Archived?
The landing page component was not being used in the Electron desktop application. Since UnifyStudy is a desktop app (not a web app), users go directly to the authentication flow rather than seeing a marketing landing page.

## If You Need It
If you want to use this landing page for a separate marketing website, you can:
1. Copy these files to a new web project
2. Update the imports and dependencies as needed
3. Host it separately from the desktop app

## Removal
You can safely delete this entire folder if you don't plan to use the landing page.
